            Bernard Arnault is back on top as thewealthiest man in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the <u>Bloomberg billionaires index,</u> Arnault
            earned $200 billion for the first time, as shares in his luxury
            goods company LVMH rose 30%.
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 20px 0px">
            Arnault, 74, is only the third man ever to earn $200 billion plus.
            Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was the first to hit $200 billion in August
            2020. Telsa's Elon Musk has also crossed the $200 billion
            threshold. At one point, Musk's net worth sat at $340 billion.

            Arnault didn't merely erect a business empire; he transformed
            industries and reshaped the way we perceive luxury in our lives.
            His luxury goods company, LVMH, witnessed a 30% rise in its shares
            the past few years, contributing to his extraordinary wealth.
