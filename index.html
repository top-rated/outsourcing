One of the most significant benefits of starting your own agency is the added value it brings to your network. You're probably already receiving numerous requests from friends, acquaintances, and colleagues who are seeking your expert advice in the digital marketing realm. By setting up your own agency and outsourcing the Google Ads management aspect, you can monetize these requests that would otherwise go untapped. It's like turning a hidden gold mine into a well-organized treasure trove!
